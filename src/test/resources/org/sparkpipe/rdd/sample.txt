illustrations. Examples include 上 shàng "up" and 下 xià "down", originally a dot above and below a
line.

Also translated as logical aggregates or associative compounds, these characters have been
interpreted as combining two or more pictographic or ideographic characters to suggest a third
meaning. Commonly cited examples include 休 "rest" (composed of the pictograms 人 "person" and 木
"tree") and 好 "good" (composed of 女 "woman" and 子 "child").
